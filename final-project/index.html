        <p>The questions we like to ask about God are endless: “Is God real?” “Is what we know about Him really true?” and “what does He have to do with my life?” just to list a few.</p>
        <p>The Bible may not answer every question about God and will often lead us to ask more, but one of the areas in which the Bible is quite definite, is the answer to the question: who is Jesus? C.S Lewis, a well-known Christian author wrote of Jesus,
          “Either this man was, and is, the Son of God, or else a madman or something worse. You can shut him up for a fool, you can spit at him and kill him as a demon or you can fall at his feet and call him Lord and God, but let us not come with any
          patronizing nonsense about his being a great human teacher. He has not left that open to us. He did not intend to.”</p>
      </div>

      <div class="para section">
        <p>Jesus commends the Apostle Peter’s confession of Him as “the Messiah, the Son of the Living God” (Matthew 16:16), because Jesus knew that who He is – and could be to us – has the power to change our lives. Jesus is so unique because two worlds
          collide in him: Heaven and Earth, the Divine and the human.</p>
        <p>Yes, His Name is the name above all names, and his star-breathing, storm-calming, miracle-working power is second to none. Yet, He is also the human Jesus, the personal friend who knows what we are going through and cares about us. That’s why
          the Bible also calls Him “Immanuel”, God with us.</p>

  <div class="article black-box" id="jesus-cares">
    <h2 class="section">Jesus Cares!</h2>
    <div class="section">
      <p>So does Jesus care about you? Yes He does! How do we know this?</p>
      <p>Often we disqualify ourselves from God’s love because of our history, our failures and shortcomings. Sin has separated us from God and we can never make up for our sin by self-improvement or good works. So how can we accept what we have not earned?
        The Bible says that nothing in all of creation can separate us from the Love of God that is in Christ Jesus our Lord. And to accept God’s love is to trust His patient, forgiving and gracious stance towards us. Only He has the power to free us
        from guilt, shame and condemnation to give us a life of wholeness. All we have to do is turn to Him.</p>
